Each call on the stack stores a separate copy of the variables defined in the function. The array is passed by reference so a separate copy of the array is not created for each function call. As we can have O(log(n)) calls to the function, the space complexity of the recursive version should include the O(log(n)) auxiliary space. Hence, the overall space complexity is:\n","\n","Input space: O(n)\n","Auxiliary space: O(log n)\n","\n","Total Space: O(n + log n) OR O(n)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"455IJXKIga1G","outputId":"de24484a-7b8f-4fc0-e2d1-318cbf26a126"},"outputs":[{"ename":"NameError","evalue":"name 'binary_search' is not defined","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[1;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mNameError\u001b[0m                                 Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[1;32m<ipython-input-42-8022011bbec5>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[1;34m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m     13\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m     14\u001b[0m \u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m---> 15\u001b[1;33m \u001b[0mbinary_search\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m(\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m[\u001b[0m\u001b[1;36m1\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m,\u001b[0m\u001b[1;36m5\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m,\u001b[0m\u001b[1;36m8\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m,\u001b[0m\u001b[1;36m9\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m,\u001b[0m \u001b[1;36m10\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m]\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m,\u001b[0m \u001b[1;36m10\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m)\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[1;33m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m","\u001b[1;31mNameError\u001b[0m: name 'binary_search' is not defined"]}],"source":["# Calls to the function O(log(n))\n","# O(n)\n","def binary_search_recursive(a_list, target):\n","    mid = len(a_list) // 2 # O(1)\n","\n","    if a_list[mid] == target:\n","        return mid\n","    elif a_list[mid] > target:\n","        return binary_search(a_list[:mid], target)\n","    else:\n","        return mid + binary_search(a_list[mid:], target)\n","\n","\n","\n","binary_search([1,5,8,9, 10], 10)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"r8W3VlLaga1G"},"outputs":[],"source":["# O(log(n) + n) => O(n)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LGi_WGdyga1H"},"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
